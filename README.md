# Taurus_Auriga
Python scripts and observe scripts prepared for SMA project, 2021A-A010. 
The observations purpose is to constrain the spectral indices of 47 Class II protoplanetary disks in Taurus-Auriga star forming region. 
The science targets were selected from Andrews & Williams (2005) by their flux densities to achieve > 10-sigma significance in < 2 hours observing time. <br /> <br />
File 'Target' list the target name, flux density at 0.85 mm, uncertainty, flux density at 1.3 mm, uncertainty from Andrews & Williams (2005). <br />
Python script 'plot' read these flux density measurements and do 1.3 mm - 0.85 mm flux density scatter plot and their distributions. <br />
File 'Target' list the submillimeter spectral index (alpha), uncertainty of the selected targets fit by Andrews & Williams (2005). <br />
Python script 'plot1' read spectral index and plot cummulative distribution of alpha for the 47 science targets. <br /> <br />
In order to minimize the
